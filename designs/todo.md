# Saw — Open Work Tracker

Open items ONLY. Landed work lives in `designs/NN-*.md` + git history
(this file was pruned Jul 30; see git history of this file for the old
landed recaps). Conventions: cite source designs in [brackets]; VERIFY
items need a probe before being treated as real work.

## Milestones
- **App-1 Blade: DONE** (design 64 + 67; real resolver/lock/git/
  incremental/self-hosting bootstrap; `make blade-bootstrap`).
- **App-2 SOS kernel (ESP32-P4, riscv32): NEXT.** Milestone: UART
  "blink" from a Saw kernel on the P4. See sos/spec.md.

## Design 72 — Small fixes: L12/M1, L9, erased-error downcasting (LANDING)
- **Commit 1 (L12/M1 — fixed-array builtins):** Fixed arrays `[T; N]` gained two
  builtin members and only these two: `.len()` (folds to the compile-time
  constant N as `Int`) and `.swap(i, j)` (the M1 escape hatch — bounds-checked
  in-place element swap, mirroring `Vector.swap`; requires a `var` receiver). The
  typechecker intercepts array-typed method calls (`_check_array_method`) before
  the old "non-struct type" error: `len`/`swap` typed + tagged, anything else a
  clean "fixed array has no method X; only .len()/.swap are available, user
  extensions on array types are not supported" error. Constant `swap` index OOB is
  a compile error (mirrors `a[const]`); dynamic index gets the always-on runtime
  bounds check. Parser: `extension [Int; N]` now emits "extension methods on array
  types are not supported" instead of the generic "Expected type name". Codegen
  `_generate_array_builtin`: `len` -> const; `swap` addresses the array in place
  via `_get_lvalue_pointer` + GEP, loads/stores the two slots (no element copy).
  Spec fixed-array section updated; `.len()` de-illustrativized. Tests:
  `array_len_builtin`, `array_swap_builtin`, `array_swap_immutable_error`,
  `array_no_extension_error`, `array_unknown_method_error`,
  `array_swap_const_oob_error`, `array_swap_dynamic_oob_panic`. Suite 796,
  bootstrap 17+17, libs 4+4. [72]
- **Commit 2 (L9 — Equatable over Optional/array members):** The synthesis
  widening was ALREADY landed (commit e60d189: `is_equatable` holds for `T?` iff
  `T` is and `[T; N]` iff its element is; codegen `_emit_optional_equals` /
  `_emit_array_equals` wired into the recursive `_emit_equals`, so struct-field,
  tuple, and direct comparisons all reach them; tests
  equatable_optional_field/_direct/_string_synth/_array_field). Design 72 closes
  the remaining brief case — an enum whose payload is an Optional — with
  `equatable_enum_optional_payload` (`Filled(value: Int?)`: Some==Some,
  Some!=Some-diff, None==None, None vs Some). Suite 797. [72]

## Design 71 — Closure Deinit (LANDED)
- **Commit 1 (core):** Closures now carry their own env destructor
  (`{fn_ptr, env_ptr, dtor_ptr}`, design 71). An escaping closure binding is an
  OWNING value: `_needs_cleanup(FUNCTION-escaping)` + `_emit_closure_drop_at`
  (null-dtor no-op) run the env destructor at the closure's own drop (LIFO +
  drop flags), releasing owned captures exactly once and freeing the heap env.
  Removed the creating-frame EARLY RELEASE: a `move` capture now clears the
  source binding's drop flag (this ALSO fixed a latent thread-`spawn`
  double-free of a move-captured NoCopy — deinit ran at frame exit AND in the
  trampoline). Copy class: escaping closures are NoCopy (move-only) — a bitwise
  copy aliased the heap env (double free, exit 133); forwarding an escaping
  closure into a NON-escaping/borrowing slot stays a lend (no move). Closure
  FIELDS excluded from NoCopy CONTAINMENT so capture-less-closure structs stay
  copyable. Exact-count battery: `closure_deinit_{drop_order,arc_balance,
  struct_field,vector,returned,dropped_uncalled,called_then_dropped,
  conditional_move}` + `closure_copy_requires_move_error`. Suite 789, bootstrap
  17+17, libs 4+4 green. RESIDUAL GAP (documented, needs value-flow not type
  analysis): an owning closure stored in a COPYABLE struct that is then copied
  still double-frees — the type can't say a field value owns an env. [71]

## Decisions needed (user input required)
- **D10.** Cortex-M0-class atomics (ARMv6-M has no CAS) — decide with
  the first such port. [19, 20]
- **SOS**: boot protocol + syscall ABI (sos/spec.md §5) — the next
  design session.

- **DF4 (meta).** Blade bit-rots as the compiler tightens — re-validate
  periodically (the bootstrap target is the canary). [49]
- **DF5.** Keywords (`extension` etc.) can't be identifiers — fine, but
  an eventual contextual-keyword sweep is noted. [49]
- **B4 limit.** A git dep's locked REV isn't pinned without
  re-resolution (build-from-lock path reconstruction is future work);
  path deps unaffected. [64, 67]
- ~~**L18 — module-qualified type annotations (found in design 68).**~~
  FIXED (design 69). The typechecker resolved a dotted annotation
  (`v: mod.Type` / `let x: mod.Type` / `-> mod.Type`) for checking but
  left the dotted `struct_name` on the AST, so codegen ICE'd "Undefined
  struct: mod.Type". Fix at the source: write the resolved (qualifier-
  stripped) type back onto the AST — free-function params (registration),
  let annotations + method params/return (a guarded `_resolve_type` when
  `_annotation_has_module_qualifier` holds, so generic/Self are untouched).
  A related typechecker gap fell out (a method with a qualified param
  errored "body has no value" because the param scope kept the dotted
  type) — fixed by the same write-back. Locked by
  `examples/l18_module_qualified_annotation.saw`. [68, 69]
- **L2.** Return-type reconciliation for type-param/associated-type
  returns in generic bodies — documented deferred looseness. [02, 24]
- ~~**L9.** `==` over Optional-/array-bearing members: deliberate clean
  error; extend the equals derivation when needed.~~ CLOSED (landed e60d189;
  enum-Optional-payload case closed under design 72): the Equatable synthesis
  lowers `T?` (None/Some-aware) and `[T; N]` (element-wise) members. [32, 72]
- ~~**L12.** Fixed arrays can't take extension methods (parse error);
  also blocks fixed-array `.len()` (spec-illustrative).~~ CLOSED (design 72):
  fixed arrays get builtin `.len()` + `.swap(i, j)` (M1 escape hatch); user
  extensions on array types stay rejected with a clear diagnostic. [40, 72]

## Deferred features (decided or triaged, not scheduled)
- Erased-error DOWNCASTING (needs a type-id design; catch-all boxes are
  opaque until then). [56]
- Debug trait (synthesized structural formatting) — own design. [56]
- Enum-direct Printable (enum method dispatch is a general gap). [56]
- Named tuple PATTERN form `(x: a, y: b)`. [63]
- Map `entries()` snapshot; Map ExplicitCopy/.copy(). [54, 57]
- Labeled-arg `_` opt-out; labeled-only enforcement. [66]
- Integer range-cover exhaustiveness. [63]
- Generic-method type-arg inference. [36]
- ~~Closure-Deinit: wire `codegen_env_dtor` into closure drop glue (C4).~~
  **CLOSED (design 71 landed):** escaping closures carry their env destructor
  and drop it at the closure's own drop (exactly once); early frame release
  removed; escaping closures are NoCopy. Residual owning-closure-in-copyable-
  struct-then-copied gap tracked under the design-71 section. [21b, 59, 71]
- `Weak<T>` (Arc slot reserved). [16, 21]
- Slices (needs own design vs no-escape refs); `\x` byte escapes;
  where clauses; extension sugar (computed properties, conditional
  extensions); submodule directories; std.io traits (Blade-driven).
  [user triage Jul 29]
- S5 small-string optimization — ABI-gated ("before separate
  compilation or never"). [07]
- Registry for Blade (salvaged sketch, old pm design): static HTTP
  index or git repo; `GET /api/v1/crates/{name}` metadata +
  `/{version}/download` tarball; `blade login/publish`. [pm_design,
  deleted Jul 30 — see git history]

## Async (post-52b roadmap)
- ~~**A5.** Effect polymorphism via monomorphization-time re-inference —
  BLOCKS generic suspending/driven functions.~~ DONE (design 70): effect
  inference runs PER instantiation (keyed by mangled symbol); the coroutine
  transform accepts suspending instantiations of generic functions/methods by
  monomorphizing them to concrete functions/methods before frame synthesis
  (driven free fn, `TaskGroup.spawn`, and `&var self` method all land). A `sync`
  context calling an instantiation that suspends is a violation reported AT the
  call, naming the instantiation + suspension path (minimal A8). Still rejected
  with precise diagnostics: a buried suspending method-on-`T` call inside a
  driven body, nested suspending generic calls, generic-struct-extension driven
  methods, and cross-module generic templates (re-ledgered below). [18, 22]
  - **A5-rest.** Buried suspending method-call embedding (drive `w.step()`
    nested in a driven body as a method sub-frame — needs Part-0c embedding, the
    method twin of Part-0b); driven methods on GENERIC structs; cross-module
    generic driven templates (design 68 territory). [70]
- **A2.** Multi-threaded work-stealing executor + Send-on-frames check.
- **A3.** Explicit-only cancellation points (`Task.cancelled()`, select).
- **A4.** IO reactor (poller-only v1, kqueue/epoll, never-block).
- **A6.** `extern blocking` offload pool. **A7.** Separate-compilation
  interface format w/ suspends bit. **A8.** Suspension-path diagnostic
  anchors. **A9.** Actor sugar. [18]
- Two runtimes coexist (thread-engine spawn/Task vs cooperative
  TaskGroup) — unification unscheduled. [21b, 52b]

## App-2 / freestanding path
- **F7** remainder: assembly boot shim + wiring (compiler surface DONE
  — @export/@section/Never, design 58). **F8** linker scripts. **F9**
  QEMU riscv32 smoke ("blink") + CI. **F10** fence/barrier primitives
  for DMA ordering. [20, 46, 58]
- ISR conventions; riscv32 target completion (i32 word landed, 47).
- **F5.** `Once`/`Lazy<T>`, `PerCpu<T>`, UnsafeCell-equivalent story.
- **F6.** dtoa/Float printing under freestanding. [20]
- ~~**T1f.** Debug info (line tables → backtraces).~~ DONE (design 69):
  DWARF line tables on by default; lldb breakpoints + `file:line`
  backtraces; panics/asserts name their source location. [tier-1]
- `AllocatedBy<Slab>` sugar. [19, 42]

## Testing & infra
- **M2.** Unit tests for lexer/parser/typechecker internals; fuzz/
  differential testing; property tests over copy/move rules. [critique]
- ~~CI: GitHub Actions workflow for suite + bootstrap.~~ DONE (design 69):
  `.github/workflows/ci.yml` (ubuntu + macos) runs the compiler suite,
  the debug-info test, the blade bootstrap, and semver/toml lib tests;
  README badge. Linux is a new target — first CI run may surface small
  follow-ups (PIC-reloc + sys.executable portability fixes landed).
- ~~Runtime error messages with source locations (subsumed by T1f).~~
  DONE (design 69): panics carry `FILE:LINE`.

## Research tier (post-both-apps)
